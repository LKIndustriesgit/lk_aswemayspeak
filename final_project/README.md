# Book Guesser #
<p> Welcome to my Book Guessing game, where I use many different text analysis and generation techniques,
like ngrams, Markov chains, nearest neighbour semantic similarity, and SpaCy AI language Processing! </p>

In the game, the player has to guess one of five books by using different text analysis tools on it.
Each tool costs a different clue penalty. 
>The lower the accumulated clue penalties, the better!
<p>Once the player feels confident in guessing the book, they have the chance to place themselves on the leaderboard.</p>

>** But don't mess it up, you only get one chance! **

<p>Even if you don't win, the game should be a fun experience with lots of replayability, especially when you add custom books [WIP]</p>

### how to run the code ###
1. Just run main.py in the final project folder
   
<p>All the other files in there are just for documentation reasons.</p>

### How to add custom books ###

- Just drop them in the books folder
  
<p>But do be warned that they may not function completely as intended</p>
